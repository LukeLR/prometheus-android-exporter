Prometheus exporter for Android phones. Prometheus Android Exporter is implemented in Kotlin in Jetpack Compose. Apart from simply exporting available metrics on the default HTTP port 10101, it can also traverse NAT by connecting to the PushProx proxy. It also supports scraping metrics locally and storing them in memory while offline and exporting them later while online using the Prometheus remote write protocol.
